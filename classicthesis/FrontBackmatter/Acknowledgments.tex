\textbf{ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS}
\end{center}

The acknowledgements page should have a two inch top margin. The word
"ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS" in all CAPS, centered is the heading.
Many students use this section to thank their committee members, fellow
students, family members, or any person they feel has contributed significantly to their
document.
